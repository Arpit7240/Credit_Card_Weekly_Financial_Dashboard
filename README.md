# Credit_Card_Weekly_Financial_Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard Weekly
Developed an interactive dashboard using transaction and customer data from a SQL database to provide real-time insights. Streamlined data processing and analysis to monitor key performance metrics and trends. Shared actionable insights with stakeholders to support decision-making processes. To clean and process data, formatted dates consistently, handled nulls with `IF()` or `BLANK()`, and removed outliers using filters. Grouped data by week using `WEEKNUM()`, calculated totals with `SUM()`, and applied conditional logic using `SWITCH()`. Utilized `CALCULATE()` and `FILTER()` for dynamic data views, with `MAX()` fetching recent or highest values. Built relationships between tables and connected DAX measures for accurate KPI tracking, ensuring clean, connected data for real-time analysis.
